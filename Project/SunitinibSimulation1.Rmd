## Comparing trough concentrations to area under the concentration-time curve

Sunitinib has an established therapeutic range for trough concentrations

* 50 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL (or 0.05 mg/L to 0.1 mg/L)

To date, there is not an established target for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)
Despite this, AUC has been shown to be correlated with measures of efficacy and toxicity more than trough concentrations

* Evident by Hansson et al. (2013) papers that modelled pharmacodynamic outcomes (biomarkers such as VEGF, sVEGFR-2, sVEGFR-3, sKIT), tumour size, absolute neutrophil count, diastolic blood pressure, occurrence and severity of Hand-Foot Syndrome and fatigue, and overall survival) during sunitinib treatment used AUC as a predictor
    
Ward and Reuter (2016) raised several issues regarding using trough concentrations as a surrogate for AUC:

* Both AUC and trough concentrations increase proportionally with dose, therefore these parameters should be correlated with each other
    + Doubling of the dose results in a doubling of the AUC and a doubling of the trough concentration
    + *However, it does not hold that a specific target trough concentration corresponds to a specific AUC in all patients given between-subject variability in clearance and volume of distribution*
    + *It is especially likely to be highly variable in patients having these therapies in cancer as clearance and volume of distribution change over a treatment period, i.e., patient weight and body composition changes as people get treated and become more physiologically 'normal' (and conversely if the therapy is not working, a cachexia phenotype will have altered the pharmacokinetic paramaters).*
    
## Population pharmacokinetic models

There are two commonly used population pharmacokinetic models published in the literature:

1. Houk et al. (2011) - separate models for parent and active metabolite, many covariates, and no correlation between key pharmacokinetic parameters
2. Yu et al. (2015) - integrated semi-physiological model describing conversion of parent to active metabolite, no covariates, and correlation between key pharmacokinetic parameters

The Houk et al. (2011) model has been used more frequently to simulate or estimate individual pharmacokinetic parameters in the literature as it is the older of the two.  However, the Yu et al. (2015) is physiologically sensible due to incorporating conversion of the parent to the active metabolite and correlation between parameters of clearance and volume of distribution.

## Simulation study

Ward and Reuter (2016) performed pharmacokinetic simulations of individuals with opposing values of clearance and volume of distribution, i.e., an individual with high clearance and low volume, and an individual with low clearance and high volume as described by the **Houk et al. (2011)** model (which was possible given the lack of correlation between these parameters).

For these two individuals:

* Concentration-time profiles given standard 50 mg daily dosing resulted in a two-fold difference in concentrations
* Administering a dose targeting a common trough concentration of 50 ng/mL resulted in different values for AUC
* Administering a dose targeting a common AUC resulted in different trough concentrations

However, do these results hold true for the **Yu et al. (2015)** model?

### Study population

1. Simulated 1000 individuals with various weights (based on a distribution as shown below)

```{r Weight Distribution, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
nid <- 1000 # Number of individuals to be simulated

# Generate distribution of weights using random number generator
# Based on the distribution used in the Yu et al. (2015) model
WT <- rlnorm(nid,meanlog = log(82.3),sd = 0.2) # Log-normal distribution
WT[WT < 39] <- 39 # Any values less than 39 kg, make 39 kg
WT[WT > 157] <- 157 # Any values greater than 157 kg, make 157 kg

# Plot histogram of weights to check
hist(WT)
```

2. Simulated random effect parameters for each of the 1000 individuals based on the model's variance-covariance matrix

3. Simulated sunitinib concentration-time profiles (parent, metabolite and total) and 24-hour AUCs for each individual given their individual values for weights and random effect parameters every hour for four weeks

* When administered 50 mg daily for four weeks
* When administered 50 mg daily for the first week, then therapeutic drug monitoring for the last three weeks
    + Titrated doses daily based on predicted trough concentrations
    + Target trough concentration was 50 ng/mL
    + Doses were not confined to tablet sizes or established dose ranges in order to let every individual achieve a target concentration of 50 ng/mL
    
### Results

Green lines are individuals with weight less than 70 kg and red lines are individuals with weight greater than or equal to 70 kg.

With standard 50 mg daily dosing, there is wide variability in concentration-time profiles between individuals.  Titrating doses to target a trough concentration of 50 ng/mL (0.05 mg/L) has resulted in all individuals achieving the target trough concentration by the end of the fourth week of dosing and similar concentration-time profiles.

With standard 50 mg daily dosing, there is wide range of trough concentrations and 24-hour AUCs for the last dosing interval of the four week period.  Titrating doses on an individual basis to achieve the target trough concentration results in similar 24-hour AUCs across the study population.

## Summary

Using the Yu et al. (2015) model, targeting trough concentrations appears to result in similar 24-hour AUC values across the population given different weights and pharmacokinetic parameters.  This is likely due to:

* The variance-covariance matrix for random effects incorporated into this model to prevent erroneous combinations of pharmacokinetic parameter values
* This model uses allometric scaling for clearance (exponent of 0.75) and volumes of distribution (exponent of 1), whereas the Houk et al. (2011) model does not include weight on clearance of the parent, and estimated the exponents for parent volume, metabolite clearance and metabolite volume (0.459, 0.296 and 0.510, respectively).  These values are substantially lower than values that are typically used.

**Note:** This model was developed using data from a single dosing interval (one 24-hour period).  As described previously, *...clearance and volume of distribution change over a treatment period, i.e., patient weight and body composition changes as people get treated and become more physiologically 'normal' (and conversely if the therapy is not working, a cachexia phenotype will have altered the pharmacokinetic parameters).*  This would not have been observed in this study's patient population.  And therefore, the random effect parameters and correlations in this model may not hold true over time.

The issues of doubling a dose that does not lead to doubling concentrations/AUC within an individual is often due to changes in time-dependent covariate values or a random change (an unmeasurable/unknown factor causing a change in a pharmacokinetic parameter) that were not accounted for during dose titration.  This could be a change in the previous dosing interval that gave rise to the measured trough concentration and its effect continues into the next dosing interval, or a change that occurs in the next dosing interval that gives rise to a trough concentration that was not expected.

The Yu et al. (2015) model does not include any covariates other than weight.  Therefore, it makes sense that in these simulations pharmacokinetic profiles between individuals follow similar shapes and we see the proportional dose/concentration/exposure relationship.

## Considerations

Implementing random changes to random effect parameters over time could add an element of reality to simulations (i.e., unknown changes in pharmacokinetic parameter values not captured by the model).  These changes could be:

* Linear change in value over time (constant increasing or decreasing of a parameter)
* Sudden change in value at a specific time-point – i.e., mid-dosing interval change that gives rise to unexpected trough concentration but depending on when it occurred in the interval, may not have had a significant impact on the individual’s AUC
* Cyclical change in value over time (described by a sine wave)
* Combination of the above
